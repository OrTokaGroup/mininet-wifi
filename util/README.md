### Building Topologies with GUI

![](https://github.com/ramonfontes/vnd/blob/master/miniedit.png)

I'm a beginner, I do not know Python and I would like to create a customized topology. In this case, both [MiniEdit](https://github.com/intrig-unicamp/mininet-wifi/blob/master/examples/miniedit.py) and [VND](https://github.com/ramonfontes/vnd) can serve as support since they provide a GUI to generate Python scripts. 


### Development
For instructions about easier development check [this helper file](doc/dev_help.md).

## Pre-configured Virtual Machine    
[Ubuntu 16.04 x64 :: Password: wifi](https://intrig.dca.fee.unicamp.br:8840/owncloud/index.php/s/1RS9FM5gWI43NDT)      
user: wifi   
pass: wifi   
   
## Note
Mininet-WiFi should work fine in any Ubuntu distribution from 14.04, but in some cases (only if you have problems when start it) you have to stop NetworkManager with `stop network-manager` (you can also use `sudo systemctl stop network-manager` or `sudo service network-manager stop`).    

## Book  
We are glad to announce that the Mininet-WiFi book has been published!   
  
While the 1st edition (237 pages) is in Portuguese, affordably available in Printed and E-Book versions, we are about to start to work on the 2nd edition in English. Hard to say when it will be out but we target 2019!   

Here are the pointers to the book:
